# Wasiqman Keyboard layout

## Introduction
This is the wasiqman keyboard layout that I use on a daily basis.
I have only tested this layout on MAC OS. Infact, I don't even have the right files for this layout in Linux (any distro) and Windows.
It is likely that when I get a daily work computer that is not a macbook, the files for this keyboard layout for more operating systems will be added.

## Why Wasiqman
This layout is based off of the [workman layout](https://workmanlayout.org/). You can read about the philosophy and reasoning behind that layout on the workman website.
The reason I felt like I needed to adapt this layout were
1. At the time, I was using [MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) as my main editor. In vim, you use the CTRL key alot, and the default layout reverted to QWERTY when you held down the CTRL button. This confused the crap out of me until I decided to re-write the layout.
2. As a programmer, I use the symbols much more than the numbers. So I have defaulted to using the symbols if you hit the number keys. Holding the shift key will get you the numbers.

## Installation
1. Pick the layout you want. (Programmer or normal)
2. Run
~~~ shell
cp /path/to/wasiqman/wasiqman.bundle /Library/Keyboard Layouts/
~~~
3. Open "System Preferences" > "Language And Region" > "Keyboard Preferences"
4. Click "Input Sources" at the top
5. Click the "+" button on the screen to add a keyboard layout
6. Select "Wasiqman" and click "Add"

*You're done!!*

## Switching Input Modes
To switch from "Wasiqman" to another keyboard layout, use the little falg at the top of your screen on the status bar.
